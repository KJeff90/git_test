Okay, so we're only about a week into our Odin Project learning experience, and thus far I'd have to say I'm really enjoying it! It's cool to be learning not just a practical new skill, but an actual professional one. And the fact that I'm essentially teaching it to myself is also very validating. That being said, this is a LOT and I'm doing my best to remain focused during my studies, but dear Lord does it get tough sometimes.
